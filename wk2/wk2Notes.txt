Reading Test Scores
-------------------
pisaTrain and pisaTest are respectively the train and test dataframes

- P1.4
na.omit(DF) removes observations w/ any missing values in dataframe DF
> pisaTrain = na.omit(pisaTrain)

- P3.1
releveling a factor variable by passing in a particular level puts that level at the top
and bumps all other lvls down one; lvls are by default ordered alphabetically
> pisaTrain$raceeth = relevel(pisaTrain$raceeth, 'White')

A lower R^2 value doesn't necessarily indicate a poor model. Rather, it  can indicate
the relative difficulty of one prediction problem relative to another.

Detecting Flu Epidemics via Search Engine Query Data
----------------------------------------------------
FluTrain and FluTest are respectively the train and test datasets

- P1.3
When building a model using data w/ a numeric response var (call it Y) whose histogram skewed right, it's often useful
to model log(Y) vs X instead of Y vs X so that a small number of extreme observations doesn't
have undue influence on the model.

- P4.1
> library(zoo)
> ILILag2 = stats::lag(zoo(FluTrain$ILI), -2, na.pad=TRUE)
Note: ILILag2 is now a 'zoo series'
> FluTrain$ILILag2 = coredata(ILILag2)
My guess is that the coredata function converts ILILag2 from a zoo series to a datatype
suitable as a dataframe column
