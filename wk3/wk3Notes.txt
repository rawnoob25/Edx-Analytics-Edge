*Large enough sample (nrows) allows more data to be put in the testing set than if sample
were smaller; this increases our confidence in the ability of our model to extend to unseen data

*usually put 50-80% of data in training set

*summary() called on a dataframe (DF) will provide a count of the missing values for each list in the DF

*(naive) baseline model in logistic regression predicts the more common class in the training dataset for
every observation in the test dataset.

*When deciding which independent variables to include in a logistic regression model, make a correlation
matrix with all the relevant (must be numeric) independent variables and the dependent variable, 
and include in the model the independent variable with highest correlation with the dependent variable.
When refining the model, consider adding in a pair of independent variables that have a low correlation with
one another.


*AIC (from summary() invoked on logistic regression model) indicates the strength of the model. Smaller AIC is better.
